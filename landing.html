								<h3 style="color: white;">UNIT 1 – Introduction to Research Methods: The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							<b>WHAT – Description</b><br>
							The first unit of the course introduced the foundational principles of research in computing, including the scientific method, deductive and inductive reasoning, and technological ethics. 
							The readings from Dawson (2015) and Andersen and Hepburn (2020) strengthened my understanding of how systematic and logical reasoning supports evidence-based decision-making in computing. 
							Ethical frameworks presented in the Menlo Report (Finn & Shilton, 2023), the BCS Code of Conduct (2021), and the ACM’s ethical principles highlighted the importance of respect, beneficence, and accountability in computing research. 
							Deckard (2023) further emphasised that the rapid advancement of AI technologies requires enhanced ethical standards to protect privacy and sustain public trust.
							</p>

							<p>
							<b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Reflection</b><br>
							This unit demonstrated that ethics are practical obligations that must be embedded into professional computing practice rather than being treated as theoretical concepts. 
							The ACM (2023) Medical Implant Risk Analysis case illustrated how transparency in vulnerability management strengthens user trust. 
							The CTO scenario showed how ethical decision-making influences the design and implementation of cloud and AI systems, particularly in relation to user data protection and regulatory compliance. 
							While validating technical hypotheses demands deductive reasoning, the unit also highlighted the role of inductive reasoning in analysing user behaviour and evaluating the broader social impact of technological solutions.
							</p>

							<p>
							<b>NOW WHAT – Application and Learning</b><br>
							In my future work, I will apply structured ethical frameworks—such as the BCS Code of Conduct and the Menlo principles—to evaluate risks and guide data governance in cloud-based systems. 
							I intend to further develop my skills in ethical risk assessment and qualitative research methods to strengthen project oversight and ensure regulatory adherence. 
							Overall, the unit demonstrated that ethical conduct and professional standards form the foundation of trustworthy innovation, supporting responsible digital transformation across computing environments.

								<h3  style="color: white;">UNIT 2 – Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							<b>WHAT – Description</b><br>
							The second unit taught me how to convert broad research concepts into specific and focused inquiry questions while also introducing effective methods for writing literature reviews. 
							The research process became clearer through Dawson (2015) and Boza (2022), who explained step-by-step techniques for selecting research topics and formulating appropriate research questions. 
							For my chosen topic, I focused on how cloud computing can support the development of efficient information systems for financial service organizations. 
							The experience of preparing a research proposal demonstrated that a clearly defined research question forms the basis for establishing study objectives, determining research methods, and shaping the overall project direction. 
							Dawson (2015) also highlighted the importance of aligning research design with project scope and available resources, which helped me structure my own research plan appropriately.
							</p>

							<p>
							<b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Reflection</b><br>
							This unit enhanced my understanding of critical evaluation and research synthesis techniques. 
							I now view the literature review as an analytical process that identifies key themes, scholarly debates, and existing knowledge gaps (Boza, 2022). 
							Hoepfl (1997) demonstrated how qualitative research evidence can strengthen quantitative analysis, particularly in organizational studies where complex behaviours and decision-making processes are involved. 
							Evaluating research evidence was both challenging and rewarding. 
							Comparing opposing findings required significant time and analytical effort, while strict adherence to academic citation rules was essential for ensuring credibility. 
							Selecting reliable and contemporary academic sources proved vital, as the strength of supporting evidence directly depends on the quality of these materials. 
							Through critical thinking and structured analysis, I learned to link theoretical concepts with practical applications relevant to my professional environment.
							</p>

							<p>
							<b>NOW WHAT – Application and Learning</b><br>
							I will apply the research and analytical skills gained in this unit to conduct a full literature review in Unit 7. 
							Using a thematic approach will allow me to organize sources around essential topics such as system efficiency, scalability, and cloud security. 
							The unit also showed me that IT management requires evidence-based decision-making rather than assumptions. 
							The methods learned will support me in my role as CTO when evaluating technology adoption projects using structured, data-driven assessments. 
							Overall, the knowledge gained in Unit 2 strengthened both my academic approach and my problem-solving abilities, which will contribute to the development of future research proposals.

								<h3 style="color: white;">e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h3>
							</header>

							<p>
								<b>Initial Post</b><br>
								The Medical Implant Risk Analysis case study from ACM (2023) presents a real ethical challenge faced by developers of healthcare technology systems. 
								Corazón, the medical technology company, created an implantable heart monitoring device relying on wireless encryption and mobile system integration. 
								The organisation aligns with ACM Code of Ethics principles including 1.1 (Contribute to society and human well-being), 2.5 (Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations) and 2.9 (Design and implement systems that are robustly and securely usable). 
								However, the presence of a hard-coded initialization value raised concerns regarding long-term data protection and patient safety.
								<br><br>
								Corazón demonstrated commitment to Principle 2.3 (Know and respect existing rules) and Principle 3.7 (Recognize and take special care of systems integrated into society’s infrastructure) by consulting independent researchers and maintaining an active bug bounty program. 
								Their actions also reflect the BCS Code of Conduct (2021) through prioritising public interest and demonstrating professional competence. 
								The collaborative problem-solving approach strengthened both public safety and organisational standards (Dawson, 2015).
								<br><br>
								The legal and social dimensions of the case show that organisations handling patient information must follow GDPR because such data is highly sensitive. 
								Corazón’s transparent and ethical approach to risk management demonstrates how professional responsibility and public trust form the basis for long-term technological progress.
							</p>

							<h4>1 Peer Response</h4>
							<p>
								Hi Rayyan,<br>
								Your discussion of software accessibility from ethical and legal perspectives shows a solid understanding of the issues. 
								Failure to implement accessibility standards violates ACM (2018) Principles 1.1 and 1.4 as it excludes disabled users and contradicts principles of fairness and well-being. 
								The BCS (2022) Code also requires professionals to provide equal access while protecting public interests.
								<br><br>
								The UK Equality Act (2010) places accessibility as a legal requirement, meaning non-compliance results in ethical and regulatory violations. 
								Finn and Shilton (2023) emphasise that ethical governance requires identifying potential harm to vulnerable groups before problems occur. 
								Deckard (2023) further argues for developing proactive ethical frameworks to support inclusive technology.
								<br><br>
								Your analysis clearly shows that accessibility is not only a technical requirement but also an ethical responsibility supporting fairness and social equality.
							</p>

							<h4>2 Peer Response</h4>
							<p>
								Hi David,<br>
								Your evaluation of Rogue Services' actions provides a strong ethical and legal assessment. 
								ACM (2018) principles require the organisation to stop supporting malicious clients, as their actions violate harm prevention, honesty, and professional responsibility. 
								Finn and Shilton (2023) note that financial incentives often overshadow ethics, reflecting wider industry governance failures.
								<br><br>
								Under the BCS (2023) Code, computing professionals must protect public interest, which Rogue Services fails to do by enabling ransomware and malware operations. 
								Their actions also violate GDPR and the UK Computer Misuse Act (1990), creating legal risks.
								<br><br>
								Service providers should implement proactive auditing systems and automated threat detection to prevent misuse. 
								Deckard (2023) argues that digital service governance requires transparency and accountability to maintain societal trust.
							</p>

							<h4>3 Peer Response</h4>
							<p>
								Hi Mark,<br>
								Your analysis shows how Corazón meets ACM (2018) and BCS (2021) ethical standards through transparent collaboration with security researchers, demonstrating professional accountability (Finn & Shilton, 2023). 
								Medical devices require full disclosure of all potential risks, even minor ones, in alignment with beneficence principles in the Menlo Report.
								<br><br>
								Corazón must keep stakeholders such as MHRA and GDPR authorities informed due to regulatory and ethical obligations (NHS England, 2018a). 
								Their governance model could be improved with additional post-market monitoring to ensure long-term safety. 
								Deckard (2023) highlights that ethical AI and system development require ongoing monitoring and open reporting to maintain trust.
							</p>

							<h4>Summary Post</h4>
							<p>
								Dear All,<br>
								This discussion provided essential insight into how technological innovation must align with ethical principles and regulatory expectations. 
								The Medical Implant Risk Analysis case (ACM, 2023) demonstrated how Corazón applied ACM Principles 1.1, 2.3, 2.5 and 2.9 as well as BCS (2021) standards by implementing strong encryption, supporting bug bounty research, and performing independent risk evaluations.
								<br><br>
								Peer feedback broadened the analysis by showing that ethical responsibility extends beyond immediate fixes. 
								Mark highlighted the importance of post-incident reporting and complete documentation (DCB0129, 2018; GOV.UK, 2025). 
								Tasnika emphasised that GDPR obligations also reflect moral responsibilities for protecting sensitive data. 
								Rayyan reinforced that ethical frameworks must evolve with technology to remain effective.
								<br><br>
								The discussion showed that computing requires continuous ethical governance, proactive accountability, and transparent reporting mechanisms. 
								Corazón’s case demonstrates how ethical behaviour, legal compliance, and social responsibility collectively support trustworthy healthcare technology.

								<h3  style="color: white;">UNIT 3 - Methodology and Research Methods</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								<b>WHAT – Description</b><br>
									The research methods and data collection techniques of Unit 3 explained how computing studies receive their design 
									and execution framework. The research methods selection process depends on philosophical assumptions which 
									Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2012) and Dawson (2015) explain through their work.
									<br><br>
									The three research approaches—qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods—became clear to me during this unit. 
									Qualitative research studies meaning, experiences, and processes, while quantitative research uses numerical 
									evidence to achieve generalizable results. The unit also explained how research design influences both the 
									direction and outcomes of a study through distinctions between exploratory and descriptive studies.
									<br><br>
									This knowledge is essential for my chosen topic, which examines cloud computing for developing efficient 
									information systems in financial services, because it requires combining technical performance insights with 
									human-centred perspectives.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Reflection</b><br>
									The unit showed me that methodology involves more than selecting tools; it requires alignment between 
									philosophical worldview, research design, and data collection methods. Saunders et al. (2012) explained that 
									researchers define valid knowledge based on their underlying assumptions. My experience as CTO has shaped 
									my pragmatist worldview because I value both quantitative performance data and qualitative user experiences.
									<br><br>
									The unit emphasised the importance of integrating primary and secondary data. Primary data provides direct 
									insights, while secondary data helps contextualise findings. Understanding this relationship strengthened 
									my ability to design an effective data collection plan.
									<br><br>
									Overall, the unit taught me that a structured methodological approach helps transform curiosity into a credible 
									and organised research plan.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>NOW WHAT – Application and Learning</b><br>
									My research proposal will adopt a mixed-methods strategy that combines quantitative system performance metrics 
									with qualitative insights collected through interviews with IT managers and organisational case studies. This 
									combined approach will help generate a complete understanding of how cloud computing improves information 
									system effectiveness.
									<br><br>
									The unit taught me to conduct thorough evaluations of validity, reliability, and ethical considerations within 
									data-driven projects. I will apply these principles within my organisation to strengthen data collection, 
									analysis, and decision-making for IT transformation initiatives.
									<br><br>
									Ultimately, the unit demonstrated how strong methodology, ethical practice, and practical application come 
									together to support credible and impactful research.

								<h3  style="color: white;">UNIT 4 - Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								<b>WHAT – Description</b><br>
									The three essential qualitative data collection techniques in Unit 4 include case studies, focus groups, and 
									observations, which help researchers understand human and organizational aspects of computing research. 
									Dawson (2015) and Priya (2020) demonstrated that case studies allow researchers to examine real systems in 
									depth to understand both technical elements and human behaviour.
									<br><br>
									Focus groups enable researchers to explore collective experiences among participants, while observations reveal 
									natural behavioural patterns in real environments (Hoepfl, 1997). These qualitative methods add interpretive 
									value to quantitative findings by providing deeper insights.
									<br><br>
									The unit taught me that studying cloud computing adoption in financial institutions requires using performance 
									metrics alongside qualitative data from employee feedback, organizational culture, and client interaction.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Reflection</b><br>
									Before this unit, my evaluation of IT systems focused primarily on numerical performance metrics. The readings 
									and discussions showed me that technical performance alone does not determine organizational success. Understanding 
									how users and stakeholders interact with cloud systems reveals their real-world effectiveness.
									<br><br>
									Priya (2020) demonstrated that qualitative case studies help researchers investigate decision-making, user trust, 
									and risk perceptions in digital environments. Chatterjee et al. (2021) showed that combining qualitative insights 
									with quantitative performance data enables organizations to better understand technology transformation outcomes.
									<br><br>
									I learned that research on IT systems becomes more ethical and more effective when technical data is combined with 
									social and managerial insights. This understanding led me to adopt user-focused evaluation methods in my professional 
									technology strategy work.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>NOW WHAT – Application and Learning</b><br>
									My literature review and research proposal will use case study methodology as the primary qualitative approach. 
									The research will examine cloud system deployments in financial institutions through interviews with IT 
									professionals and focus group discussions.
									<br><br>
									Observations will allow me to study how users adapt to cloud tools and how workflow efficiency changes as a result. 
									By integrating quantitative performance analysis with qualitative methods, the research design will capture both 
									technical outcomes and human experiences.
									<br><br>
									The research outcomes will help me develop standardized assessment protocols for cloud project implementation, 
									measuring user satisfaction, system performance, and security perceptions. This approach supports digital 
									transformation by connecting technical objectives to organizational standards and ethical expectations.

								<h3  style="color: white;">UNIT 5 – Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								 <b>WHAT – Description</b><br>
								The research methods of interviews, surveys, and questionnaire development serve as important data collection 
								tools for computing research. Combining interviews for deep qualitative insight with surveys for quantitative 
								data from large groups allows researchers to achieve comprehensive understanding. Questionnaires act as the 
								organizational framework connecting both methods (<em>Dawson, 2015</em>).
								<br><br>
								The Cambridge Analytica scandal (<em>Confessore, 2018</em>) demonstrated the dangers of online surveys when 
								ethical and legal procedures are ignored. Data collected via seemingly harmless Facebook quizzes were later 
								exploited to create political profiles for manipulation. I evaluated a cybersecurity awareness questionnaire 
								by assessing its structure, question clarity, and fairness. This revealed three major issues: biased questions, 
								unclear language, and insufficient disclosure about participant rights.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Reflection</b><br>
								The exercises helped me understand how data collection practices affect ethical standards and research quality. 
								The Cambridge Analytica case highlighted how violating ACM (2018) and BCS (2021) codes, including failure to 
								obtain informed consent and ensure transparency, leads to ethical breaches, social harm, and loss of public trust.
								<br><br>
								Evaluating the questionnaire improved my ability to analyze research tools, showing that question design affects 
								reliability and validity. Data quality depends on the collection instrument and the researcher’s ethical approach 
								to protecting participants and understanding context. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods strengthens 
								research on user behavior and system functionality.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>NOW WHAT – Application and Learning</b><br>
								I will apply these lessons to improve my research proposal and future computing projects. Questionnaires will 
								combine open-ended and closed questions to ensure clarity, depth, and impartiality. Pilot testing will help 
								identify biases or confusing elements. I will uphold ethical standards by obtaining participant consent, ensuring 
								response anonymity, and following GDPR compliance.
								<br><br>
								The unit strengthened my skills in selecting and implementing suitable data collection techniques. It demonstrated 
								that research trustworthiness depends equally on ethical oversight and proper methodology to maintain professional 
								standards in computing research.
